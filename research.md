#### Identifying Agglomeration and Congestion Elasticities: Implications for Optimal Spatial Policy

I structurally estimate a model of economic geography to assess the wage subsidy policy that would result in an optimal reallocation of workers across locations within the United States. I extend a general model of economic geography by adding a government that can levy a tax and conduct place-based policy through direct employment. With this model, I estimate the elasticities that govern local agglomeration and congestion forces by using the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) program conducted between 1988 and 2010. This policy is well-suited for this analysis because it mimics a large-scale program of local interventions in its effects—substantial changes in local employment—but impacted locations were not chosen based on their economic characteristics. Specifically, the use of local military base closures through the BRAC program, instead of a place-based policy targeting locations with lagging economic indicators, separates agglomeration and congestion spillovers from local natural advantages. With well-identified estimates of the spillover elasticities, I characterize the optimal wage subsidy policy and compare the resulting allocation of workers with the competitive equilibrium. In combination, the model and these estimates can be used to evaluate the aggregate impacts of policies that have a heterogeneous effect on local productivities, amenities, and transportation infrastructure.

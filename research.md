#### Identifying Agglomeration and Congestion Elasticities: Implications for Optimal Spatial Policy \[[Link](../assets/docs/reasner_jmp_0731.pdf)\]

I quantify agglomeration and congestion spillovers using variation from a natural experiment by instrumenting for changes in local employment with proposed changes to civilian employment at military installations through the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process. I find an agglomeration spillover elasticity consistent with the existing literature. However, my estimate of the congestion spillover elasticity is smaller in magnitude than common parameterizations of quantitative economic geography models. All else equal, with a weaker congestion spillover elasticity, more of the distribution of economic activity across space is due to natural advantages and disadvantages, which implies that the gains from implementing an optimal spatial policy are smaller. 

### Works in Progress:

#### International Sourcing and Firm Learning: Evidence from Serbian Firms

We quantify the impact of neighboring firms' importing experience on the decision to start sourcing inputs from new markets using data from Serbian firms. We find that firms are more likely to start importing from a new market if neighboring firms in the same industry have experience importing from that market and if those firms are increasing their imports over time. Further, our results support a distinction between imports and exports for the decision to enter foreign markets; unlike exports, import sourcing choices are not independent across countries. In particular, we find that imports across origins are substitutes, not complements. Together, these findings suggest that a firm's spatial connections are an important contributor to its access to foreign markets as sources for inputs.

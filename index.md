Welcome! I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Economics](https://krannert.purdue.edu/academics/Economics/) at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/). My research focuses on economic geography, i.e., spatial variation in economic activity, and international trade, with an emphasis on economic development policies. <!-- You can find abstracts, working papers, and a list of works in progress on my [research]({{site.baseurl}}/research/) page. --> 

Before coming to Purdue, I graduated from [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/) with a BA in [Economics](https://as.vanderbilt.edu/economics/). I have also worked as a Research Analyst (Short Term Consultant) at the [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/). 

I will be on the 2021-2022 job market and I expect to graduate in May 2022. 

When I am not in my office, I enjoy taking in nature while running or hiking. I also love to travel, especially when I get a chance to scuba dive or ski!
